Enter the maximum age you would like empty SnowGlobes to remain, after which they will be removed.

This is the final cleanup for items that are no longer needed; Max Age and Max Count won't remove the snowglobe, it will only tear them down. Set this
value to a low number (Say 1h) so that they are cleaned relatively quickly if no longer needed.

This distinction is so that usecases where it's possible that you might need to re-start a system after it has gone out of scope, so that we don't initially delete those SnowGlobes.

Specify as hours, days, minutes; e.g

2d
8h
1w

(2 days, 8 hours, 1 week respectively)
